Health for Dummies:
Health for dummies is a basic website meant to locate many common ilnesses and over the counter medicines/treatments in one place. It is meant for users who constanly google basic knowledge (ex. searches "What to take when you have a fever" or "What is ibuprophen for").

The original plan was to create a frontend design that allowed the user to look through a list of common illnesses or medecines (depending on what they were intrested in finding information on). Upon selecting either and illness or medecine, the user would be given basic facts and information on the illness or medecine.

Information for illness includes symptoms and possible treatments, such as over the counter recommendations and/or home remedies. Information on medecine incluedes what symptoms the medication treats.
