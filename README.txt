Health for Dummies:
Health for dummies is a basic website meant to locate many common 
illnesses and over the counter medicines/treatments in one place. 
It is meant for users who constantly google basic knowledge (ex. 
searches "What to take when you have a fever" or "What is 
ibuprofen for").

The original plan was to create a frontend design that allowed 
the user to look through a list of common illnesses or medicines 
(depending on what they were interested in finding information 
on). Upon selecting either and illness or medicine, the user 
would be given basic facts and information on the illness or 
medecine.

Information for illness includes symptoms and possible 
treatments, such as over the counter recommendations and/or home 
remedies. Information on medicine includes what symptoms the 
medication treats.

We wanted some form of user interaction to make the site more
dynamic, so we changed our idea to allow the user to select
symptoms and input their own. Depending on the symptoms, the site would suggest
illnesses the user might have and how they can take care of
themselves using the reccommended remedies.
